# Bidirectional Visitor Counter
The code uses two IR sensors to count the number of vistor entering or leaving.
This program uses the [LCD Library](https://github.com/nipun24/ATMEGA16_libraries/blob/master/lcd_library/lcd.h) to display the number of visitors on the LCD.

**NOTE:** Replace the switch in the schematic with IR sensor. There might be some changes to make in the code according to the sensor.
